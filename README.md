# Rust Cryptography Interest Group (RCIG) Coordination Repo

This repository is the central [issue tracker] used by the RCIG in order to
coordinate efforts towards promoting cryptography in Rust.

## Mission
Our mission is to foster a robust Rust cryptography ecosystem:

- Create a focal point for discussion and work on Rust cryptography in general
- Provide overall direction for cryptography in Rust by forstering collaboration on an interoperable cryptographic ecosystem
- Act as a resource for answering questions about the use of cryptography in Rust projects
