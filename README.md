# Rust Cryptography Interest Group (RCIG) [![Zulip Chat][chat-img]][Zulip Chat]

This repository is the central [issue tracker] used by the RCIG in order to
coordinate efforts towards promoting cryptography in Rust.

## Join in!
Come talk with us via [Zulip Chat] or by [opening an issue].

## About
This repository is where the Rust Cryptography Interest Group stores the following:

- meeting  minutes from Sync-Up calls
- open issues based on ongoing discussions
- suggest follow  up topics of discussion for future sync-up calls
- be a place where the community  coordinates. 

The aim will be for this repo to evolve an archive and a place where actionable items can be 
picked up easily by members of the RCIG community. 

## Mission
Our mission is to foster a robust Rust cryptography ecosystem:

- Create a focal point for discussion and work on Rust cryptography in general
- Provide overall direction for cryptography in Rust by forstering collaboration on an interoperable cryptographic ecosystem
- Act as a resource for answering questions about the use of cryptography in Rust projects

Note that this is a new group and figuring out its exact purpose is a work-in-progress.
As we figure out a governance process we will be revising our mission statement and
hopefully publishing a [vision document].

## Projects
- [Awesome Rust Cryptography] - curated list of  actively maintained,
  high-quality Rust cryptography libraries.
